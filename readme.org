** my current emacs setup.

- GNU Emacs 31.0.50
- Fedora Linux 40 x86_64 Linux 6.10.6-200.fc40.x86_64

note: this repo started out as a fork from magnars/.emacs.d repo, but
meanwhile the former 'master' branch is renamed to 'magnars' and the
current master branch is my current config, from scratch. I chose to
retain the 'magnars' branch for historic / nostalgia purposes...
