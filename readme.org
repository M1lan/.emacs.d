GNU Emacs 31.0.50 on Linux 6.10.6-200.fc40.x86_64

* my current emacs setup
note: this repo started out as a fork from magnars/.emacs.d repo, but
meanwhile the former 'master' branch is renamed to 'magnars' branch
for historic / nostalgia purposes and the current master branch is my
current config, from scratch. this also means, that this repo is
actually no longer a fork of magnars/.emacs.d in the usual
sense. pardon, I was to lazy to make a new repo.

* ideas
- "minimal" startup from only 4 files: init, custom, keybinds, and
theme.  all the rest is pulled in from init.el using straight.el and
use-package.el. first startup will fetch everything. subsequent
startups will update.
- use M-x customize for everything except faces!
  - try keep custom-set-faces empty
  - put faces into theme instead!
- avoid package.el like the plague!
  - instead we roll with straight.el and use-package.el
- stay away from things like doomemacs or spacemacs.. use vanilla
  GNU/Emacs
- completely ignore existance of Windows and MacOS because with zero
  due respect, fuck Apple and fuck Microsoft.
- no stupidity like "helm" or "evil-mode". THIS. IS. EMACS.
  - modal editing sucks! I want normal editing and shortcuts!

* instructions
- make backup of existing directory ~/.emacs.d/ (just rename it)
- clone repo to ~/.emacs.d/ or symlink
- make edits as you see fit
- have recent Emacs installed (get latest tarball if distro sux)
- run Emacs first time
  - it does whole bunch of things... wait
  - if no fail: all good
  - if fail: restart with --debug-init and fix things
- check contents of ~/.emacs.d/ have been updated
- make sure to keep ~/.emacs.d/.gitignore updated
- check everything before push changes! don't include secrets!
